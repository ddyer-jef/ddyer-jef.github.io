    <h2>Where to sit in a canoe</h2>
    <p>Before you just jump into a canoe all willy-nilly, there are some things you should have figured out, like where the bow <em>(front)</em> of the boat is and where the stern <em>(back)</em> is. You should also figure out who's sitting where. The easiest way to figure out where the bow of the boat is, is to look at the seats. The end that has the larger space between the end of the boat and the seat is the bow—if you try to sit in the rear seat as a front seat, you'll see the issue very quickly as there won't be much room for your legs.</p>
